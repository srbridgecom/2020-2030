                Privacy and Cookie Policy</br></br>
</br></br>We are built on the foundation of increasing transparency, we offer millions of the latest job listings, combined with a growing database of reviews, internal approval ratings, salary reports, interview reviews and questions, benefits reviews, photos and more. Unlike other sites, all of this information is shared by those who know a company best — the we, us, our sites, iterationlinc employees. In turn, job seekers on I are well-researched and more informed about the jobs and companies they apply to and consider joining. This is why thousands of employers across all industries and sizes turn to us;  to help them recruit and hire quality candidates at scale who stay longer. 

</br></br>Privacy and Cookie Policy

</br></br>We explain in this Privacy and Cookie Policy (the “Policy”) how we collect, process and/or use information that we receive via our websites, emails we send, and mobile applications (collectively, the “Platform”) that link to this Policy, as amended from time to time. This Policy describes how  Iterationlinc collects, processes, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access, and correction of your personal information. For purposes of this Policy, personal information shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
</br></br>Unless we specify otherwise, this Policy applies only to information we collect, process and use through the Platform. This Policy does not apply to information that we collect through other channels, such as information that we collect offline, from other websites or from emails you send us, unless we notify you at the time of collection that this privacy policy applies.
</br></br>For the purposes of this Policy, “Iterationlinc,” “we,” or “us” shall mean the following entities: Iterationlinc
      
</br></br>Information We Collect
</br>We collect information about you to provide our services. In order for us to best provide our services to you (and to help make it feasible for us to do so), it is essential that we are able to collect and use the information as described in this Policy. If you are a registered user of the Platform the data collection is largely necessary for fulfilling our contractual obligations towards you and, where neither of those is the case, alternative legal grounds serve as our legal basis for processing (i.e., consent, legal obligation, and legitimate interests—see details below).


</br></br>Information You Give Us

</br></br>When you fill out registration forms, submit your resume, or provide us with other personal information actively, we collect that information for processing and use in accordance with this Policy. Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with personal information also may change, but here are some examples of situations in which you will have the opportunity to provide personal information to us:
</br></br>
    • Creating an account</br>
    • Signing up for email alerts</br>
    • Completing a form related to one of our products or services</br>
    • Uploading a CV, Resume</br>
    • Completing your Profile or preferences</br>
    • Sending messages through we, us, our sites, iterationlinc </br>
    • Contacting us for technical support or customer service.</br>

</br></br>Depending on how you interact with our Platform, the personal information we collect from you may vary. For example, to create an account we may ask only for an email address and password. In other circumstances, such as when you complete a form related to a particular service offering, we may ask you to provide other information, which may include your name, phone number, and/or postal address. We also collect and store certain information associated with actions you take. For example, when you search for jobs, we store the titles, locations and general salary range (if available) of jobs you search for and click on. We also store information about the job postings that you apply to, the time and duration of your activity on our Platform, and other information about your behavior on our Platform. Because much of this information is necessary for us to provide you with our service, if you don’t share this information you may not be able to use some features of the we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  platform.

</br></br>If you connect to the Platform using Facebook, Google+, or another social networking site (each a “Social Networking Site”), we will receive information that you authorize the Social Networking Site to share with us, which may include public profile information, birthday, current city work, school, and email address. When we receive this information, it becomes we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  account information for purposes of your use of the Platform. This information also constitutes personal information and is therefore subject to this Policy. Any information that we collect from your Social Networking Site account may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the Social Networking Site, so please consult the Social Networking Site’s privacy and data practices. You have the ability to disconnect your Social Networking Site account from your we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  account by adapting the privacy settings in your Social Networking Site account. If you come to the Platform through a Social Networking Site, from other websites or with devices that enable third parties to collect information from or about you, such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies.

</br></br>On certain we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  domains, when you set up an individual user account on the Platform, you may create a profile (a “Profile”) that will include personal information you provide. At your request, we will create your Profile with information we extract from a resume you have uploaded on the Platform. When you fill out and save your Profile, your saved Profile can be viewed by prospective employers, subject to visibility settings you control. (For example, when you apply to certain Easy Apply jobs posted by a we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  employer client, we may share a static image of your saved Profile with that employer in connection with your application). Because your anonymity on our Platform is important, your Profile does not include information you submit to the Platform anonymously (for example, the reviews, salaries, benefits, and company ratings information you submit anonymously).

</br></br>We may host an Easy Apply application that asks for relevant information generally considered sensitive (such as a driver’s license number for truck driver job, or a government-issued identification number for a government job). Some applications may ask you to identify your racial/ethnic origin or disabilities on a strictly voluntary basis (e.g. for purposes of providing equal employment opportunities) and you may choose not to submit this information without any detriment to your application. For our EU users, data about racial/ethnic origin and disabilities are considered special categories of personal data under Article 9 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). When we host Easy Apply applications that collect this kind of data, we pass that information along to the employer when we submit your application and do not retain it on our systems. But please remember, you should not include this kind of data in any resume you upload to the Platform or submit it in any other scenarios, except where we specifically prompt you to provide such information such as described above.

</br></br>Some of our Easy Apply applications allow you to apply to a job hosted on the site of one of our affiliates. When you click on the Easy Apply button, and confirm by clicking the Apply button, your application will be submitted for the job through one of our affiliates. Before the Apply button, you will see a notice informing you that the application is hosted on an affiliate’s site, including a link in the affiliate’s terms and privacy policy. You will have the opportunity to open the affiliate’s terms and privacy policy and read them prior to submitting your application.

The service provider is not permitted to use the information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.

</br></br>When you submit personal information to a third party and are informed at the time of collection that your information may be shared with us, we may collect that information for lawful marketing purposes.

</br></br>Employers with Free Employer Accounts may provide us with work email addresses of their employees for use to send an email asking those employees to leave candid reviews of the employer on the Platform.

</br></br>Categories of personal information collected by we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  may include Job Postings (your job postings on we, us, our sites, iterationlinc ), Profile Information (Name, Email Address, Resume, Current Job Title, Past Job History, Age, Gender), Sales & Support History (Purchase History, Payment Details, and other sales support interactions), Job Applications (jobs you have applied to), Job Interests & Activity (job preferences and your activity interacting with jobs, e.g. saving a job), Security & Login Information (Your login events, password changes, email changes and mobile device information), Site Activity (Pages you viewed and “like activity”), Marketing Activity (Marketing programs you have joined, content downloaded, etc.), User Feedback (Feedback you have provided we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  via email, app/website and other channels), and/or Content You Contributed (Employer reviews, Salary Reports, Benefit reviews, Interview reviews, Employer photos).

</br></br>Cookies And Tracking Technologies. Technologies such as: cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called “flash cookies”), mobile identifiers and similar technologies (“Cookies”) are used by we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  and our partners (such as advertising, marketing and analytics providers) (“Ad Partners”). We use Cookies to remember users’ settings as well as for authentication and analytics. These technologies may be used in analyzing trends, administering the Platform, tracking users’ movements around the Platform and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or Android phone. We collect the device type and any other information you choose to provide, such as username, geolocation, or email address. We also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software records information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

</br></br>Most of the personal Data processed by we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreements with you (among them, your agreement to our Terms of Use and this Policy), or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement. An example of this would be where we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  sends a job seeker’s application to an employer.
</br></br></br>Legitimate Interest
</br></br>A second ground relied upon by we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  for other types of processing of your personal information is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by we, us, our sites, iterationlinc . Such legitimate interests may include where we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  sends you marketing about our products and services or where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf. A further example would be where we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  shares your personal information with our affiliates as detailed in the “How We Share Information/Recipients” section above. we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.
</br></br></br>Compliance with a Legal Obligation
</br></br>A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  to comply with a legal obligation. An example of this would be where we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  is required to retain business records for fixed periods of time or transmit them to a user in order to comply with local legal requirements. Another example is when we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  collects Equal Employment Opportunity (or similar programs in your country) information on behalf of employers as part of the process of processing your applications to employers through the we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  platform.
</br></br></br>Consent
</br></br>Finally, in certain limited situations, we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  relies on your consent in order to process your personal information. Where we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  requires your consent in order to collect and process certain personal information, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured unless we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  has another lawful basis on which to rely. For example, your consent may be sought where you submit feedback to we, us, our sites, iterationlinc , or in certain instances where you initiate a marketing message or other communication with we, us, our sites, iterationlinc . You can withdraw your consent, as detailed in the “Other Important Privacy Information” section below, where applicable.
</br></br></br>Additional Personal and Demographic Information You May Elect to Give Us
</br></br>At we, us, our sites, iterationlinc , our mission is to help everyone find a job and company they love. We also believe transparency is one of the most powerful forces for good in the world. At its core, transparency about the workplace empowers people with the right information to make the right decisions about their careers. In an effort to innovate and evolve, and in order for us to take workplace transparency to the next level, you now have the option to provide us with personal diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) information. 
</br></br>In particular, we may ask you to provide (and we may subsequently collect) certain categories of D&I information about you, including information relating but not limited to:
    • Age</br>
    • Disability</br>
    • Gender Identity</br>
    • Language</br>
    • Leading Personality Trait</br>
    • Marital Status</br>
    • Parental Status</br>
    • Race & Ethnicity</br>
    • Religion </br>
    • Sexual Orientation</br>
    • Veteran Status</br>
</br></br></br>D&I Information Principles
</br></br>We recognize that some of these categories of information are sensitive and very personal. We therefore want to be fully transparent in how we collect and process this data so that you can make an informed decision whether or not you want to provide this information to us. 
</br></br>First, you are never obligated to provide this information to access or use the we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  platform. we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  will always remain a place you can visit to find out information about companies and jobs without the need to supply personal information beyond your comfort level, i.e., the level at which you elect to share information about yourself (except as required in order to use a particular service, such as personal information necessary to apply for a job).
</br></br>Second, we will only collect and process D&I information based on your explicit consent.
</br></br>Third, you will always have the option at any time to remove previously supplied D&I information, or to update D&I information that may have changed.
</br></br>Fourth, we employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures to safeguard the information we collect online. However, you should know that no company can fully eliminate security risks, so we cannot make guarantees about any part of our services.
</br></br>Fifth, we use D&I data only for the purposes described in this Policy unless we notify you at the time of collection that we may use it in some other manner.
</br></br>Sixth, we take precautions to ensure that your decision to provide your D&I information does not inadvertently negate your anonymity or reveal your identity on our platform. For example, we may limit the number of reviews or other pieces of content required with certain D&I attributes for those D&I attributes to become visible to the public in order to ensure that we do not inadvertently disclose sufficient information about a particular user’s personal attributes that would make them identifiable. While we take your anonymity extremely seriously and make our best efforts to ensure that D&I information does not inadvertently lead to your identification, there are two instances in which such disclosure of a user’s identification may occur:</br></br>
    1. In order to provide a voice and agency to those who, regardless of the risks of identification, affirmatively wish to have their opinions and experiences heard, we may provide an option for users to opt into the disclosure of their D&I data in a manner and to an extent that may lead to loss of their anonymity on our platform. These choices will be conspicuously marked and will require affirmative assent to verify your understanding, intention, and acceptance of this risk of identification.</br></br>
    2. While we try very hard to plan for all contingencies, we are not perfect. The preventative measures we take and our platform’s technological performance may not always function the way we intend when combined with the complex realities of many millions of unique workplaces into which we have limited, imperfect visibility. As we collect more personal information about our users that may be displayed publicly, there may be instances where the mechanisms we have designed to protect your anonymity fail. This is never our intention, and we take multiple steps to ensure this is not the case. But, in the interests of transparency, we want to be sure we make you are fully aware of this risk.
</br></br>Seventh, we will never sell or transfer your D&I information to a third-party in a way that would present a risk to your anonymity (i.e., we will never transfer your D&I information to a third-party in conjunction with other particular information about you sufficient for a third-party to identify you). We may, however, disclose your D&I information to one of our affiliates or service providers as defined and described in this Policy to enable affiliate or service-provider data processing for purposes consistent with this Policy and the principles outlined herein (see the section of this Policy titled “How We Share Information/Recipients”). We may also anonymize and/or aggregate and make available data to third parties and the public as described in this Policy (e.g., to provide insights into diversity metrics in particular areas, industries, companies, or countries, or make available data reports outlining economic or labor trends).
</br></br></br>How We Use D&I Information 
</br></br>Depending on your selections if and as you elect to disclose D&I information, we will use the data you provide to implement new platform features, track various diversity and inclusion trends across industries, countries, and globally, and push employers to begin sharing diversity data and make changes to their practices in response to the insights we provide.
</br></br>As a registered user of our Platform, we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  processes your D&I and some non-D&I information in accordance with our contractual obligations based on the Terms of Use, this Policy, and your consent for the following purposes: </br></br>
    • Providing insights into wage discrepancies (e.g., showing gender and racial/ethnic wage gap disparities)</br></br>
    • Providing D&I-based analysis of jobs and companies (e.g., we may utilize D&I information to generate reports highlighting employers that best embrace diversity, support LGBTQ rights, minimize wage gaps, etc.)</br></br>
    • Providing diversity and inclusion metrics and ratings (e.g., provide insights for job seekers who want to learn more about diversity and inclusion with respect to specific industries or companies)</br></br>
    • Providing search optimization and filtering via diversity data (e.g., providing users the ability to filter we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  content or companies based on certain employer qualities or employee experiences and attributes; for example, employers that are supportive of LGBTQ+ rights or who are particularly supportive of women with respect to enhanced maternity leave benefits; As users provide D&I information, their reviews may be associated with aggregated categories, such as filtering for all the African-American, Pacific Islander, and Latinx reviews for a particular company/all the reviews for an industry. In some instances, particular reviews may be tagged with D&I attributes.)</br></br>
    • Enhancing employer/employee diversity disclosures for job seekers (e.g., we may allow employers to share internal diversity data, diversity program details, and testimonials from their own employees;  we may provide opportunities for jobseekers and employees to engage and have anonymous discussions on D&I-related and other topics, ) </br></br>
    • Incorporating D&I information into existing or new products and services otherwise detailed in this Policy (see the section of this Policy titled “How We Use Your Information”)</br></br>
</br></br></br>How We Share D&I Information/Recipients
</br></br>As we describe in Section Seven of our D&I Information Principles above, we may share D&I information consistent with our Policy overall. Please refer to the section of this Policy titled “How We Share Information/Recipients”.
</br></br></br>Cookie Policy and Ad Choices
</br></br>This Cookie Policy describes how we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  uses Cookies and similar technologies.
</br></br></br>Cookies
</br></br>Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone, or other device when you first visit a page. We use cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called “flash cookies”), mobile identifiers and similar technologies (“Cookies”) to help us recognize you on the Platform, enhance your user experience, understand usage of the Platform, and show you relevant advertising. Cookies may also be set by other websites or services that run content on the page you’re visiting. After you register on the Platform, we may connect information we collect from the Cookies set by us and our partners with other information received from you. The provision of your data via Cookies is voluntary except for those Cookies that we place on your device because we need them for the performance of our Platform and our services.
</br></br></br>What types of Cookies do we use?
</br></br>We use two types of Cookies on the Platform: “session cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that remain on your device until you leave the Platform. A persistent Cookie remains on your device for much longer until you manually delete it (how long the Cookie remains will depend on the duration or “lifetime” of the specific Cookie and your browser settings).
</br></br></br>What are Cookies used for?
</br></br>Cookies transmit information about you and your use of the Platform, such as your browser type, search preferences, job titles, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. With the exception of an identifier Cookie that we associate with registered accounts to prevent fraud by members of the Platform, Cookies link to certain unique information such as the job titles that you entered at time of registration or on your profile, but this is not linked to your name. We use four types of cookies: Strictly Necessary, Functional, Analytics, and Targeting. You can reference which specific cookies fall into each category by using our Cookie Consent Tool in our website footer.
</br></br></br>We use Cookies for things like:
Purpose
Explanation</br></br>
Authentication
We use Cookies to help us determine whether or not you’ve signed in to the Platform and to keep you signed in during visits as you access different pages.</br></br>
Security
We use Cookies to enable and support security features, prevent fraud, and protect your data from unauthorised access.</br></br>
Preferences and Features
We use Cookies to enable features and help us provide you with personalised content, such as showing you your recent search activity.</br></br>
Advertising
We use Cookies to deliver, evaluate and improve advertising, such as by using information about you to provide relevant advertising both on and off the Platform. Our Ad Partners may use a cookie to determine whether you’ve already been shown an advert or how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interacted with an ad.</br></br>
Analytics and Performance
We use Cookies to analyze how our visitors use the Platform and to monitor site performance. These Cookies help us to identify and fix errors, understand and improve services, research and test out different features, and monitor how our visitors reach our sites.</br></br>
</br></br></br>Targeting Cookies: Ad Choices and Managing Cookies
</br></br>we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  works with several third parties to provide you with personalized, interest-based advertising. We may target ads to you, and measure their performance, on and off the Platform using:</br></br>
    • Member-provided profile information (e.g., job title, occupation, location, authorized information shared from your Social Networking Site)</br>
    • Your use of the Platform (e.g., search history, job clicks, companies you follow);</br>
    • Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket).</br>
    • IP address or mobile device location information (to the extent you have enabled location tracking on your device);</br>
    • Cookies (both on and off the Platform) which may include information from the Ad Partners we use to help deliver relevant ads to you.</br>
</br></br></br>How We Work with Third-Party Ad Partners
</br></br>When we work with our Ad Partners to serve you personalized, interest-based advertising, we do not share information with them that they can use to identify you or associate with you as a specific individual unless you have instructed us to do so (such as when you fill out a lead form in an ad, or approve your Profile for display to employers). Similarly, if one of these Ad Partners has information about you saved in one of their own Cookies on your browser, they use that information to help us send you a relevant ad, but they do not share with us information that we can associate with you as an individual.
</br></br>We work with third parties, such as Google Analytics, to provide analytics services that use the Cookies set on your device to measure the performance of advertising and track traffic to we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  generally. We have also implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, which categorizes Cookie information so that we and third-party service providers can better deliver advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on the Platform and various websites across the internet. In addition, a Cookie on some of our employer clients sites provides us with aggregate data about the number of applications submitted to those sites by users of Platform.
</br></br></br>Consenting to Cookies and Opting Out of Cookies

Additionally, you can also control, manage and/or delete cookies via your browser settings. A useful resource for information about deleting and controlling cookies can be found at AboutCookies.org.

In such instances, we do not share your location with the advertiser or advertising network; rather, we provide the advertiser or advertising network with a means to push ads through to users located in certain areas. You may disable location services at any time in your device privacy settings or the we, us, our sites, iterationlinc  native app settings.
