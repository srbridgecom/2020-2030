       </br></br> ◦ Governing Law. These Terms and any and all claims, disputes, or other legal proceedings by or between you or us, including but not limited to any such claims or disputes that are in any way related to or arising under these Terms or your access to or use of we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws principles that may otherwise provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The parties agree that their arrangement under these Terms is in interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies to the construction of the "Agreement to Arbitrate" provision below. For any claim, dispute, or other legal proceeding not subject to the "Agreement to Arbitrate" provision below, the claim or dispute shall be brought and litigated exclusively in the state courts located withinNevada as appropriate, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of each of these courts for the purpose of litigating such claims or disputes.
       </br></br> ◦ Agreement to Arbitrate. If you reside in the United States, subject to the Exceptions to Arbitration set forth below, you and we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC each agree that any and all disputes between consumer users of we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC and we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC arising under or related in any way to these Terms and such users' use of we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this section. With the exception of the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in this "Dispute Resolution" section, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate will still apply.
        </br></br>  Exceptions to Arbitration. This Agreement to Arbitrate will not apply to the following: (a) small claims court cases that qualify; (b) legal proceedings that involve efforts to obtain user-identifying information; (c) any legal proceedings brought against any of the we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC by companies or other legal entities; or individuals acting on behalf of such companies or other legal entities; (d) any legal proceedings brought by any of the we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC against companies or other legal entities or individuals acting on behalf of any such companies or other legal entities; and (e) a party's right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. If, for some reason, the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in this Dispute Resolution section cannot be enforced, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate will not apply. Where this Agreement to Arbitrate does not apply, the remainder of this Agreement and the Dispute Resolution section will continue to apply.
        </br></br>  Informal Dispute Resolution. If either of us intends to seek arbitration under the agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating arbitration. Notice to we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC should be sent to the Litigation Department. If you have an account on we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC, notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your account. The notice of dispute ("Notice") must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC may commence formal proceeding.
       </br></br>   Arbitration Procedure. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), if applicable, as modified by this section. The AAA's rules and a form for initiating the proceeding are available at www.adr.org. Any settlement offer made by you or we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. Unless otherwise required by the applicable arbitration rules, the arbitration shall be held in Nevada. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, you and we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you or we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same we, our services, our sites, ITERATIONLINC user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
